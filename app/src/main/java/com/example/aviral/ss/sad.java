The artist of “Sunday Morning Wabash River” is Zach Medler, the curator of Small Spaces Lafayette. This piece is a recreation of “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,” which is on display at the Art Institute in Chicago. Medler mentioned that one of his motifs throughout his artwork, which is evident in this piece, is to take classic paintings and add a twist to them. This specific art piece is on an extremely large scale, completely viewable from the street and surrounds Bernadette’s Barbershop. The size, location and artwork itself brings an artistic vibe to an artistic business. When you look closely, you can see that the characters in the artwork are on mobile devices, showing Medler’s thoughts on how technology is absorbing our lives.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.4189319\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89487767\", \"id\":\"1\", \"image_location\":\"img_01.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Aaron Bumgardner\",\"desc\":\"The artist of this piece is Aaron Bumgarner.

This particular piece is posted up on a street post, making it necessary for you to look up to see the artwork. Located right next to a stoplight at an intersection, it is put in the perfect spot for cars passing by to see as well as pedestrians walking the street. The signs all say different things, and are usually are positive messages or compliments such as this one.

She has a personal passion for patterns, which she featured in this piece. The geometry of the art interacts with the geometry of the building beyond just the lines of the panes of glass. For example, the wide red line is an extension of the fire escape stairway, and several of the lines run parallel to that. The teal pattern section not only relates to the stairway, but appears to come out of the vent. This piece incorporates components of the building with the art which joins the canvas with the content. Missing and broken sections of glass just further the relationship between the art and the building and add to the abstract, jagged geometry.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42007323\", \"geo_long\":\",-86.89256559\", \"id\":\"3\", \"image_location\":\"img_03.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Paul Meadows\",\"desc\":\"Local tattoo artist Paul Meadows, co-owner of The Tattooed Heart, painted this mural for Matty in 2014.

Inc, directly next to a mural painted by another co-owner of The Tattooed Heart, Robert Brumbaugh. The styles and colors compliment each other well and add a bit of cohesiveness to the street art. Most pieces vary in design and colors from one to the next, which is expected from the variety of people painting them. However, these two pieces are so consistent and interrelated, it is tough to not to be drawn to both. This piece, along with the other, work extremely well with the space, adding a bright and cartoonish atmosphere to an otherwise bland and old building.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.4189319\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89487767\", \"id\":\"4\", \"image_location\":\"img_04.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Richard Brumbaugh\",\"desc\":\"This Richard Brumbaugh piece resides on the building considered by the curator to be the center of Small Spaces.

Brumbaugh, a local tattoo artist, was sought out by Medler in order to showcase artists from the Lafayette community. Brumbaugh’s style is inherited from classic sailor tattoos, and those motifs are evident in this piece. Combined with the surrounding artworks and Brumbaugh’s, Small Spaces has completely transformed an old factory building into a notable community gathering place. With local flair and international variety, Small Spaces has taken a normal building and brought creativity to the city of Lafayette.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42008872\", \"geo_long\":\",-86.89234184\", \"id\":\"5\", \"image_location\":\"img_05.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Jason Profant\",\"desc\":\"Created by Kevin Burdick, a street artist who studied at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh and has had his artwork on the cover American Iron, a Harley Davidson magazine, this image gazes out into the street and instantly steals your attention away from anything else. The face in this art piece belongs to the well-known movie star, Clint Eastwood. His green undertones and customary Clint Eastwood stern gaze bring to life your favorite cowboy, drill sergeant, or astronaut. Definitely the most awe inspiring piece in the row, Burdick’s painting naturally draws you back toward the old warehouse as Eastwood’s gaze follows you down the street. Along with the other pieces of art, this painting puts life back into an otherwise plain building. If you notice the archway the painting is in, Eastwood appears to guard the building from what could possibly be an old entrance to the building.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42010769\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89225587\", \"id\":\"6\", \"image_location\":\"img_06.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Paul Meadows\",\"desc\":\"Created by a tattoo artist, Jason Profant, this painting looks like it might jump off the wall and start chugging down the street. This image connects to the strong ties the city of Lafayette has with the railroad. Profant’s artistic talent is shown in this image with an amazing glowing light on the front of the train and a serene alpine landscape in the background. Surrounded by grim images, Profant’s painting brings a lighter, happier element to the street while bringing to life a large, steam powered train. The enthusiastic face on the train makes you smile and remember your childhood experiences. This work of art could depict the green train engine Henry from the Thomas the Tank Engine series, who once had a red overcoat on him.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42010916\", \"geo_long\":\",-86.89218835\", \"id\":\"7\", \"image_location\":\"img_07.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Zach Medler\",\"desc\":\"Zach Medler (a.k.a. ZMED) is not only the artist of this specific piece, but is also the founder and curator of the Small Spaces Lafayette project.  Just a few years ago his goal of reenergizing and reconnecting his hometown with street art has now become a reality, as Zach continues to work on and grow Small Spaces Lafayette. His piece seen here, called, “American Neo-Gothic” is inspired by Grant Wood’s “American Gothic,” a wildly famous and often parodied 20th century painting. Notice how Zach integrates the air conditioner and locates it on the second floor of the house, as it at first glance appears to be a window or regular aspect of the house. Medler’s piece, surrounded by a barren and industrialized area of Lafayette, won’t scream out at you, but is brilliantly done by juxtaposing the “old” versus the “new,” in reference to the technologically dependent society we live in today.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42010398\", \"geo_long\":\",-86.89213249\", \"id\":\"8\", \"image_location\":\"img_08.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Bethany Homan\",\"desc\":\"The artist of this mural, Bethany Hohman, is known for her whimsical, and adorable characters.

This particular mural depicts TOWBY, which is an acronym for “the one who was born yesterday”, on the Haywood Printing Building, near Bernadette’s Barbershop as part of a larger collection of works. Bethany’s unique art style distinguishes this work from others nearby as the adorable and lovable TOWBY, provides a strong contrast to the grim Clint Eastwood mural, and the ironic painting by Zach Medler nearby. The degree to which it fits into space is interesting since it makes use of the air conditioner and window by giving it wings. The AC appears to be unplugged from its natural position, and its color helps to separate it from the content of the mural.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.4200939\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89197278\", \"id\":\"9\", \"image_location\":\"img_09.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Brock Richert\",\"desc\":\"This Brock Richert piece is stationed on the central building of the Small Spaces project. Painted around an air conditioner, its patterns resemble electronic circuitry and the energy flowing out of the machinery. Aside from an interesting coherence with its surroundings, it is worth noting that Richert is a former Purdue student. Small Spaces has aimed, from the start, to connect with the younger residents of West Lafayette, particularly Purdue students. Pieces such as Richert’s help bridge that gap and create a connection between the cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette. Purdue and Lafayette have much different demographics and Lafayette has long sought a way to reach the students of Purdue. With continuing initiatives West Lafayette and Lafayette may soon relate to one another more than they have in the past.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.4200939\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89197278\", \"id\":\"10\", \"image_location\":\"img_10.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Unknown\",\"desc\":\"The artist of the above piece is unknown.

A post-up is a piece of graffiti artwork that is printed on paper and then put up using wall paper adhesive. Post-ups are meant to be temporary and this serves to indicate that the artist is expecting it to be short lived.  It changes the look of the white and slightly dusty shutters behind it by giving it a feel of old and an impression that is meant to look run-down.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42014419\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89193985\", \"id\":\"11\", \"image_location\":\"img_11.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Kevin Burdick\",\"desc\":\"This artwork is done by Kevin Burdick. Burdick is a local tattoo artist who has contributed to Small Spaces with another piece, “Eastwood.” When providing artwork to Small Spaces, Burdick is consistent with the use of faces and vibrancy. This piece is on a large scale wall on an open sidewalk for all of the community to see. The artwork completely transforms the space by the use of color. Most of the colors used are vibrant, and pop against the dark brick wall surrounding it. While walking past this on the street, it truly captures your attention. The artwork pulls you in and makes you feel mysterious and out of this world. The blue skin truly transforms this piece from just a portrait to a landmark people plan to visit. Take time to notice the artwork surrounding this particular piece.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42025057\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89194291\", \"id\":\"12\", \"image_location\":\"img_12.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Aaron Bumgarner and Pete Brown\",\"desc\":\"Co-created by Lafayette local and former Purdue University student, Aaron Bumgarner, and Indianapolis artist, Pete Brown, this piece shows a creative take on street art.

If you notice the piece of glass broken out of the window, it creates an interesting addition to the effect this painting. You might not think much of it at first but Bumgarner and Brown’s painting has much to offer. This piece blends blends in on a low traffic street but actually has many exciting aspects to it.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42032566\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89191586\", \"id\":\"13\", \"image_location\":\"img_13.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Aaron Bumgarner\",\"desc\":\"This piece of artwork was created by Aaron Bumgarner. It is a spray paint variation of the famous image of Muhammad Ali standing triumphantly over his rival, Sonny Liston. Ali had knocked Liston down with a seemingly insignificant punch that almost no one saw land, and he was yelling at Liston to get up and fight. This highly anticipated match lasted on two minutes and twelve seconds, and it is still debated how Ali won so quickly with what became known in the sports world as the “Phantom Punch.” The artwork readily draws the eye of passersby because they likely recognize the iconic pose. It provides a contrast with the nearby artwork by presenting something much more raw and gritty. It is also interesting to notice how Muhammad Ali is portrayed with a halo around his head, as if he is an angel. Consider why the artist would use such imagery.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.4203383\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89190626\", \"id\":\"14\", \"image_location\":\"img_14.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Temre Stanchfield\",\"desc\":\"This artwork is done by Temre Stanchfield.

This is on a street with multiple other art pieces, incorporating artistic unity in that particular place. It is on a medium size scale and is completely viewable from the street and sidewalk. There is a sense of nature when viewing this artwork, almost as if being in the forest, and it makes an urban area feel more natural and rural. There is also a calming feeling when viewing this piece, which may be from its simplicity. Try to visit this piece in the afternoon to see the full effect of the shadow casted upon the window.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42036657\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89190348\", \"id\":\"15\", \"image_location\":\"img_15.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Unknown\",\"desc\":\"The original piece painted here was created by local artist Sagan Newham.  The artwork that used to be here was called “Walking Men”, and it showed a crowd of bald, zombie-like figures slowly fading away into nothing.  However, the artwork was eventually painted over, leaving the current blank canvas that is present today.  In the absence of artwork, holes have been punched in the wall, and scribbles from other people can occasionally be found around the space.  The stark white paint stands out against the dull bricks of the building, attracting the attention of passerby.  This piece is unique among the other artwork because it is actually the absence of any art that actually creates a place around the area.  Small Spaces has expressed interest in possibly painting a new mural here again someday in the future.  Only time will tell what kind of new art will be used to fill in the gap that this piece currently occupies.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42025057\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89194291\", \"id\":\"16\", \"image_location\":\"img_16.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Cathryn English\",\"desc\":\"Created by a local artist, Cathryn English, this astounding piece looms over the alleyway. Located on a boarded window of the Haywood Printing Co. Inc. building, this piece is unlike the other paintings on the building, which are generally bright while this one has dark tones and an almost menacing aura. It is in complete contrast to the painting directly left of it, as one is dark with harsh contrast and the latter is bright with soft colors. The piece seems to stand guard over the alleyway, confronting passersby and drivers alike. The gaze of the character seems to follow people when they walk or drive by. While this painting definitely adds some darkness and bleakness to the alleyway, it does offer insight to people by getting them to think about their futures and when they will make their dreams a reality.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.4204531\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89200715\", \"id\":\"17\", \"image_location\":\"img_17.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Carrie Wing\",\"desc\":\"Carrie Wing, the artist of this mural, was a Purdue student who graduated with a dual major in Fine Art and Art Education. Her inspirations ranged from David Hockney to David Byrne, with most of her stylistic inspiration coming from the city of New Mexico and graphic novels, which is evident in this mural through her unique use of color. As a former Purdue Student, she wishes to make Lafayette a better place through her art. The overall color palette of this work is quite earthy, making it fit in better with the wall around it. To further that effect, the dark blue borders blend in with the surroundings and provides contrast for the main content of the mural, making it noticeably pop in its surroundings. The droplets of dark blue paint on the window sill give the illusion that it was painted recently.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42046198\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89206578\", \"id\":\"18\", \"image_location\":\"img_18.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Alejandra Carrillo-Munoz\",\"desc\":\"This mural was painted on the back wall of Haywood Printing Building by Lafayette native Alejandra Carrillo Munoz.

One can observe the different nuances of each mural which are part of a collection of four decorating previously boarded-up windows. This painting is not only very distinctive from the other three pieces of art but also from all the other artwork of Small Spaces. This contributes to the curator’s agenda of beautifying the rundown areas in Lafayette in a diverse manner.

It depicts a blue bird in flight. Bumgarner dedicated this piece to his mother, which is likely why it appears much more serene and peaceful than some of his other works. For example, Bumgarner’s spray paint image of Muhammad Ali (artwork # 14) is much cruder and does not have the same amount of color found in this bird image. This contrast shows his versatility as an artist. Notice how the eye-catching color and patterns of the art piece manage to both contrast with the dark brick of the building, while at the same time meshing with the patterned nature of the brick. The patterns that radiate outward from the flying bird are beautiful in their hand drawn symmetry; they are coherent and flow together while at the same time their imperfections maintain originality.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42048012\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89211072\", \"id\":\"20\", \"image_location\":\"img_20.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Aaron Bumgarner\",\"desc\":\"Created by Aaron Bumgarner, this is one of the smaller of the artwork and is harder to find.

This piece is a paste-up which is art that was done on a canvas and then glued to a wall. Every other piece is painted and permanent while this one is temporary.

Medler has other works that also center on robots; he says that he enjoys making art that is in relation to technology. This piece is located on a large building that has many other Small Spaces art pieces, the different styles of which create an exciting mural of various colors and shapes. All these pieces make the building a destination; people see one piece, then are drawn to another, and soon they are traversing downtown Lafayette in search of all the other Small Spaces art. It is also interesting to consider the uniqueness present in “Robot Yearbook”; each robot is given its own look through the use of different shapes.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.42042734\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.8923794\", \"id\":\"23\", \"image_location\":\"img_23.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Paul Meadows and Richard Brumbaugh\",\"desc\":\"Done by local tattoo artists Paul Meadows and Richard Brumbaugh, this piece has more of a tattoo style.

The building gains some attention on the back from this piece, which is rather large compared to some and is very noticeable. The smiling bird and slightly evil-looking flower have a pleasing color scheme and fun appearance.

Evidently, from her use of the buildings’ lines, Lisa was able to see the beauty and gain inspiration from a rundown, downtown building. There are several printing companies in the downtown Lafayette area, and this textile-inspired piece may remind onlookers of the artful textiles created inside of these drab buildings.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.41993733\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89162935\", \"id\":\"25\", \"image_location\":\"img_25.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Zach Medler\",\"desc\":\"This piece, titled “This is My Social Media”, was painted by Zach Medler, the curator of Small Spaces.

Through this piece, Medler communicates that the art that he does is his form of social media, meaning it is how he likes to express himself to the world. The art also fits the general purpose of the Small Spaces project by showing how artists can create places by using their art.

Consider the different features present on the creature: it has horns, the beak of a pelican, a feathery mane, another head emerging from its mouth, and even a strange type of tail. The piece draws your eyes away from the dumpster and parking lot that it is located in, and draws you into corner of fantasy.

It fits with the many paper flies that surround it on various spots around the building and city.The paper design is meant to peel and fade as time passes creating a dilapidated effect. The flies, created by Zach Medler can serve as a sort of scavenger hunt around the city. If you are feeling adventurous, try to find them all. The placement of this paste up is significant because it makes the bland boarded-up window pop. There is also a distinct contrast between the earthy tones of the brick wall and the stark black and white of the wolf.\", \"geo_lat\":\"40.41987617\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.8912266\", \"id\":\"35\", \"image_location\":\"img_35.png\"},{\"artist\":\"Aaron Molden\",\"desc\":\"Aaron Molden created this paste up wolf art piece of a wolf surrounded by flies made by Zach Medler (ZMED). Paste ups are art pieces designed on paper, cut out, and glued to the wall with a mixture of flour and water. Because of it’s method of creation, the work will have a shorter lifespan than much of the other artwork as it will wear away over time as it is exposed to the natural elements. This illuminates the true impermanence of street art as in the future, it will likely degrade and be covered with a new piece. Medler’s flies show up in many places downtown, creating a theme which connects murals around Lafayette. \", \"geo_lat\":\"40.41983408\", \"geo_long\":\"-86.89125335\", \"id\":\"36\", \"image_location\":\"img_36.png\"},]}";
